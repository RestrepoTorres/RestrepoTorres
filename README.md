## Hi, I'm Victor Restrepo 🦝
I'm an intermediate computer science student, with infinite passions, and finite time.
* I have skills on Java, C#, Web, Python.
* I want to learn about data science, Blockchain, Algorithms, Cryptography, Graphs, Robotics, Linux, C,  and I know It's a lot, and a single mortal life probably would't be enought, but I'll do or I'll die trying 🦝🤘.
* I'm currently searching for my first job on tech industry.
